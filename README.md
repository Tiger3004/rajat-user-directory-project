- Project Setup and Architecture:

1. Setup:

The project is set up using React.js, a popular frontend JavaScript library.
Material-UI is used for styling and layout components, providing a set of reusable UI components for React applications.
React Router is used for managing navigation between different views in the application.

2. Component Structure:

The project consists of multiple components organized in a modular structure.
Components are responsible for rendering UI elements and managing their respective logic.

3. State Management:

State management is handled using React Context API.
A UserContext is created to manage the application state related to users, filters, and searches.
The UserContext provides data and methods to manipulate user data across different components.

4. Routing:

React Router is used for declarative routing in the application.
It enables navigation between different views, such as the user list view and the user details view.

5. Responsive Design:

Material-UI components are used to ensure responsive and accessible design across various devices and screen sizes.
The application layout adjusts dynamically to fit different viewport sizes.
